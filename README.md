## Project Structure:
We organize the project according to the works of each week. The source code is pushed to the correspoding folder for the week, named WeekX.

### Week 1
- We use the script main.py to train the model.
- The presentation for the work done this week can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WBQWrhNQ5ybHa9XmfLkyJsPHMqfX2ilstxTsrWRO5X0/edit?usp=sharing).

### Week 2
- The script inference.py is used to obtain inference results by changing the model configuration.
- train.py is used to train Faster R-CNN on KITTI dataset. Hyper-parameters need to be fixed in the script.
- The presentation for the work done this week can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cxh8sIgiQTOaXbjc6ygp3B-W5Z3nnfGUZHmHK0JMc9c/edit?usp=sharing).
- A short report in statr-of-the-art Object Detection approaches applying deep models [Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/project/604ea82ef214fb49037574d8).
